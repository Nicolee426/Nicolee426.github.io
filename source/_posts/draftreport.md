### Introduction
The raw signals generated from different logics and data sources can vary greatly, with differing value ranges. To better compare these signals in later stages and facilitate their integration into machine learning models, signal standardization is necessary. In long-short strategies, the sign of the signal typically indicates whether to go long or short, while the magnitude of the signal determines the position size. Therefore, a range of [-1,1] (where all signal values are mapped to this interval) is selected to achieve this standardization goal.
The following sections will discuss several commonly used signal standardization methods and their applicability in different scenarios. For demonstration purposes, the momentum of the *** Index is chosen as the raw signal in the subsequent discussion.

### Method 1: Converting Signals into Three Discrete Positions (-1, 0, 1)
This method is straightforward and forcefully limits the signals to just three positions: -1, 0, and 1. It's a simple yet intuitive way to standardize the signals by restricting them to these discrete levels.
The results are as follows:
**Note:** The following three charts will be presented for all subsequent methods:

1. Histogram of Signal Distribution: Visually represents the distribution of positions and allows assessment of whether the standardization meets expectations.
2. Cumulative Strategy Return: Compares the cumulative return of the constructed strategy against the ***'s cumulative return.
3. Backtesting Statistics: Includes key backtesting metrics such as ******, offering a quantitative evaluation of the strategy's performance.

### Method 2: Applying Decay via Weighted/Exponential Moving Averages
Building on the basic three-position strategy (-1, 0, 1), this method introduces decay through weighted or exponential moving averages to reduce turnover. In Method 1, the strategy often led to frequent trading. By introducing decay, the goal is to lower the turnover rate. One approach to achieve this is by using weighted or exponential moving averages.
It's important to note that this method is highly sensitive to the starting point, as different initial data choices can lead to significant variations in the standardized signals. However, the moving average approach ensures that the signals are still mapped within the range of [-1,1].
Here, we focus on the weighted moving average approach, though the exponential moving average is similar and can be implemented using ewm().
In this example, a 5-period weighted moving average is applied, with weights assigned from distant to recent data as follows: weights = [*, *, *, *, *].
The results are as follows:

After testing this method, it indeed reduces the turnover rate, but both return and Sharpe ratio also drop significantly. Therefore, for momentum signals, this decay method may not be ideal.
### Method 3: Using Tsrank to Process Raw Signals and Construct Positions
In this method, a 20-period lookback is used to calculate the moving rank of the raw signal, which then determines the current position. Additionally, the *** function directly returns values within the range of [-1,1], so no further standardization is needed.
The results are as follows:

Howerver, according to the above statistics, the performance of this approach is not very satisfactory.
### Method 4: Using Z-score Processing to Construct Positions
The calculation formula of Z-score is as follows:![image.png](images/post2-4.png)
**Note:** After Z-score processing, the data satisfies mean=0 and std=1, which makes different datasets more comparable. To map the values to the range [-1,1], we applied an additional normalization step. Currently, Z-score is one of the more commonly used methods for signal processing.
The results are as follows:

According to the backtesting statistics, Z-score processing significantly reduced the turnover rate. However, for momentum factors, the performance was not as ideal.
### Method 5: Using Logarithmic/Exponential Transformations to Construct Positions
This section focuses on this method, which has demonstrated superior performance across various factors in testing. The discussion will cover the construction logic, mathematical principles, code implementation, and backtesting statistics.

- Scope of Application: This method requires that the signal is not a simple binary signal (e.g., moving average cross strategy) but one where the strength of the signal (which translates to position size) is influenced by the magnitude of deviation from a critical condition.
- Construction Logic: Two key principles when standardizing signals are to preserve the characteristics of the original signal as much as possible while ensuring the position distribution aligns with market logic within the range of [-1,1].

The method builds upon a commonly used normalization approach, expressed as follows:
                                             ![image.png](images/post2-6.png)
To map the standardized signal from [0,1] to [âˆ’1,1], we naturally consider: ***
To align with market logic, we want the signal's sign to correspond to the direction of the trade (long/short). Therefore, it's necessary to preprocess the original signal. For the momentum signal in this example, no additional preprocessing is needed since the signa's construction already aligns with this logic.
To highlight the original signal's characteristics, with the sign extracted, we explore three transformation scenarios and derive the mathematical expressions accordingly:

- If the signal is linearly distributed: ![image.png](images/post2-8-1.png)
- If the signal is concentrated near 0 with small absolute values, logarithmic transformation is used to amplify differences:![image.png](images/post2-8-2.png)
- If the signal is concentrated at large absolute values, exponential transformation is used to amplify differences: ![image.png](images/post2-8-3.png)

These transformations follow a consistent logic. For the momentum signal, since the distribution is concentrated near 0, we use a logarithmic transformation. Given that the domain of the logarithmic function does not include 0, we perform the following transformation:
                                                 ![image.png](images/post2-9.png)
In summary, for the momentum signal, the logarithmic transformation standardization function is:

Substituting the momentum signal gives:

The results are as follows:

Compared to the backtesting statistics of the previous methods, Method 5 (logarithmic transformation) achieves the highest Sharpe ratio and the lowest turnover rate, making it the best-performing approach.
